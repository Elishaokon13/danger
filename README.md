- NEP-145 Storage Management: [NEP145](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/StorageManagement.md)

## Installing

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js ‚â• 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Run the local development server: `yarn && yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet! Running `yarn start` will tell you the URL you can visit in your browser to see the app.


## Build and deploy your contract

1. Build the smart contract:
   `yarn build:contract`
2. Deploy the smart contract
   ` near deploy --acountId=<testnet account near> --wasmFile=out/main.wasm `
3. (Optional) In the `assembly/index.ts` file, you can modify the function ft_initialize` to replace the stub parameters with your own parameters.
4. Use near-cli to initialize your fungible token
   `near call <Your Contract Account> ft_initialize --account-id <Your Near Test Account Id>`
   (In the scripts folder you can find some files with a lot of useful commands.)
5. Mint some token in your address: `near call $CONTRACT ft_mint '{"account":$ID_ACCOUNT,"amount":"100"}' --account-id $ID_ACCOUNT`
6. Launch your Near wallet and begin interacting with your new token.
7. Set contract name in code
Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.
    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'your-contract-here!'
